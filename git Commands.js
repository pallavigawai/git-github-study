/**************************** A List of Git Commands *****************************/
1. git init [directory]                 :Create a new Git repository from an existing directory
2. git clone [repo / URL]               :Clone a repository (local or remote via HTTP/SSH)
3. git add [filename]                   :Git notifies you if you have any untracked files. If you want Git to start tracking a file, run the following command
4. git reset [commit] -- [file_path]    :Unstage Files on Git
   Working with Git usually involves adding all the files to your index to prepare them for a commit. If you want to remove some files from the index before committing, you have to unstage the files in Git.
   One way to unstage files on Git is to run the git reset command.
5. git commit -m "Notes about the commit": Create a Commit
   After adding the specified files to the staging environment, instruct Git to package the files into a commit using the git commit command. Git then stores that file version. You can review the stored version at any given time.
