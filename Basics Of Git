/********************* GIT & GITHUB *********************/

What Is Git and What Is GitHub
# GIT:-
 * Git is the most popular version control system (VCS) in the world. It records changes made to your code in a repository and allows you to roll back to a previous state in case of a mistake or a bug.
 * Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system that handles source code changes in software projects of all sizes. Git allows multiple developers to work together on the same project with ease.
There are two types of version control systems:

* Centralized. All team members connect to a central server to get the latest code copy and share their contribution with others.
* Distributed. In a distributed VCS, every team member has a copy of the project and its history on their machine, allowing them to save snapshots of the project locally.
  The issue with a centralized VCS is the single point of failure. If the server goes down, team members can't collaborate or save snapshots of their project.
  Git is a distributed VCS that resolves the single point of failure issue because it allows members to synchronize their work even if the central server is offline.
   
On the other hand, GitHub is a company that offers a cloud-based repository allowing developers to store and manage their code and to track and control code changes. You can use Git without GitHub, but you can't use GitHub without Git.
