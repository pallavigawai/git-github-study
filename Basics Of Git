/********************* GIT & GITHUB *********************/

What Is Git and What Is GitHub
Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system that handles source code changes in software projects of all sizes. Git allows multiple developers to work together on the same project with ease.

On the other hand, GitHub is a company that offers a cloud-based repository allowing developers to store and manage their code and to track and control code changes. You can use Git without GitHub, but you can't use GitHub without Git.
